This is a very simple shell like interface for CLI activities.

More will be added to this, but for now, this is the basic
idea:

#include <unistd.h>
#include <ccli.h>

static int say_hello(struct ccli *ccli, const char *command,
			const char *line, int argc, char **argv, void *data)
{
	char *this = (char *)data;
	int i;

	/* command matches argv[0] */
	/* line is the full line that was typed */
	/* argc is the number of words in the line */
	/* argv is the individual words */

	printf("You typed %s\n", line);
	printf("which is broken up into:\n");
	for (i = 0; i < argc; i++)
		printf("word %d:\t%s\n", i, argv[i]);

	printf("And this is passed %s\n", this);

	printf("Type 'exit' to quit\n");

	/* returning anything but zero will exit the loop */
	/* By default, ccli will add the "exit" command to exit the loop */
	return 0;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	struct ccli *cli;
	char *this_data = "something here";

	cli = ccli_alloc("myprompt> ", STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO);

	ccli_register_command(ccli, "hello", say_hello, this_data);

	ccli_loop(ccli);

	ccli_free(ccli);

	return 0;
}

More will come shortly.
